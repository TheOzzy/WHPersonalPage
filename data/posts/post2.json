    "content": "The world of AI is changing, at a rapid rate, it feels as if the opportunities to make something great is slipping away from me each second, an idea I have has already been done by somebody and eveytime I think I’ve found something unique it turns out it’s already been done by somebody else. It’s frustrating and annoying. There is an idea, the personal assistant. I’m not talking about a chatbot where it takes prompts like questions and spits out an answer, I’m talking about an artificial companion, connected across different devices. In also every Sci-Fi movie/tv show and novel the idea of a somewhat sentient AI with it’s own thoughts and feelings (to a certain extent) would exist, conversations wouldn’t be straight forward as if you’re talking to Siri or Alexa but instead a more personable conversation as if you’re speaking to a work colleague, friend or even crew member on a ship. I’ve not got a name for this project or idea, that’ll have to come as I keep formulating this idea. The idea to walk into my office and speak, ask questions about project I’m working on and converse on what would or wouldn’t work sounds like complete Science Fiction but the more LLM’s and push towards advancing AI I think it’s just around the corner. More developments to come until then, I’ll have keep thinking \n🤔💭"
